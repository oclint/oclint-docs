Naming

LongVariableName
----------------

**Since: 0.7**

Variables with long names harm readability.

This rule is defined by the following class: `oclint-rules/rules/naming/LongVariableNameRule.cpp <https://github.com/oclint/oclint/blob/master/oclint-rules/rules/naming/LongVariableNameRule.cpp>`_

**Example:**

.. code-block:: cpp

    void aMethod()
    {
        int reallyReallyLongIntegerName;
    }

**Thresholds:**

LONG_VARIABLE_NAME
    The long variable name reporting threshold, default value is 20

ShortVariableName
-----------------

**Since: 0.7**

Variable with a short name is hard to understand what it stands for. Variable with name, but the name has number of characters less than the threshold will be emitted.

This rule is defined by the following class: `oclint-rules/rules/naming/ShortVariableNameRule.cpp <https://github.com/oclint/oclint/blob/master/oclint-rules/rules/naming/ShortVariableNameRule.cpp>`_

**Example:**

.. code-block:: cpp

    void aMethod(int i)  // i is short
    {
        int ii;          // ii is short
    }

**Thresholds:**

SHORT_VARIABLE_NAME
    The short variable name reporting threshold, default value is 3
